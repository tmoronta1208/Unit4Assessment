# Unit4Assessment

How many of the steps you were able to complete by the end of the assessment
I was able to complete part01 but unable to finish the last two parts. 

Which parts/concepts you found easy to implement, or felt you understood how to implement well

The fragment creation portion was doable but I still need to practice coding and memorizing all of the steps.

Which parts/concepts you found hard to implement, or felt you did not completely understand how to implement well.
The JSON parsing inside of a recycler view took me much longer than i anticipated.
